# aws-terraform-module-vpc

[![OSO DevOps][logo]](https://osodevops.io)

---

This Terraform module contains the neccessary resources for creating a best-practices Virtual Private Cloud (VPC) setup in AWS.

As per AWS best practices, a single VPC will be created with both public and private subnets, each subnet placed in a seperate availability zone. Each of the private subnets have their own private NAT gateway to allow internet access for resources hosted within the private zone of the network.

This project is part of our open source DevOps adoption approach. 

It's 100% Open Source and licensed under the [APACHE2](LICENSE).
